it sounds like you are looking for an algorithm for multi-class prediction. one commonly used algorithm for this task is the random forest algorithm, which is known for its versatility and ability to handle multiple classes effectively. another popular choice is the gradient boosting algorithm, which can also handle multi-class problems efficiently.

ultimately, the best algorithm for your specific needs will depend on factors such as the size and nature of your data, the level of interpretability required, and the computational resources available. it may be helpful to experiment with a few different algorithms to see which one performs best for your particular dataset and prediction task.
