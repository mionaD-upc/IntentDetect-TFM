Error (Not able to find label in answer)

if you have data that does not belong to any of the three classes that you have trained your svm model on, you can handle this by treating it as an outlier or anomaly. in this case, you can use the svm model as a binary classifier to detect whether the data belongs to one of the three classes or not. if the svm model predicts that the data does not belong to any of the three classes with a high confidence score, you can classify it as an outlier or anomaly.

alternatively, you can also consider retraining your svm model with additional classes that represent the outlier or anomaly category. this way, your model can learn to differentiate between the three classes you are interested in and the outlier category. this approach may require collecting more data that represents the outlier category and retraining your svm model to better handle such cases.

ultimately, the best approach will depend on the specifics of your dataset and the nature of the outlier data you are dealing with.

Error (Not able to find label in answer)

one approach you could consider for this task is using a recurrent neural network (rnn) or a long short-term memory (lstm) network. these types of neural networks are well-suited for processing sequential data, such as sentences in a paragraph. by training the model on your dataset of paragraphs and their corresponding sentence categories, the model can learn to predict the category of a sentence based on the context provided by the preceding and following sentences.

additionally, you may want to explore techniques like attention mechanisms, which can help the model focus on specific parts of the input sequence that are most relevant for making a prediction. this can be particularly useful when there is a strong relationship between sentences in a paragraph.

i recommend looking into research papers and text books on natural language processing (nlp) and sequence modeling for more in-depth knowledge and insights on how to approach this problem. good luck with your project!
