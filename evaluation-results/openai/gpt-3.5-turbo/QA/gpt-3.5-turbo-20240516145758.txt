Error (Not able to find label in answer)

if you encounter data that does not belong to any of the three classes you have trained your svm model on, you can consider it as an unknown or outlier class. in this case, you can either choose to discard the data, label it as a separate "unknown" class, or retrain your model to include this new class.

one approach is to add an additional class label for data that does not fit into any of the existing classes, such as "other" or "unknown." this can help the model better handle out-of-distribution data during prediction.

alternatively, if the data does not fit into any of the existing classes and you have a significant amount of this data, you may consider retraining your svm model to include this new class. this will enable the model to better generalize to new and unseen data.

ultimately, the best approach will depend on the specific requirements of your application and the nature of the data you are working with. it is essential to consider the potential impact of the unknown data on the performance of your svm model and choose the most suitable strategy accordingly.
