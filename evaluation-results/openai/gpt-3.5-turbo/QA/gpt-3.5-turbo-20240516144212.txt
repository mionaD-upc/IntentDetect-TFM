Error (Not able to find label in answer)

when dealing with data that does not belong to any of the three classes in your svm text prediction model, you can handle this problem by creating a separate "other" or "unknown" class to classify these instances. this way, any data that does not fit into the defined classes can be assigned to this new class. 

alternatively, you could also consider re-evaluating your feature selection, data preprocessing steps, or model parameters to see if there are any ways to better capture and classify these outlier instances. it may also be useful to gather more labeled data that represents this outlier class to improve the model's ability to classify such instances accurately. additionally, exploring other machine learning algorithms or ensemble techniques may also help in improving the model's performance on these outlier instances.
